Export your Deezer playlists to a workable format.

Just specify your userid as the first commandline argument, and you're good to go.
To find your Deezer id, the easiest way I found was to look into a Deezer page
source once you're logged in, and search for USER_ID.
It currently looks like:
```
var USER = {
USER_ID : 3939391,
```
